            <p>The Olympic-class ocean liners were a trio of British ocean liners built by the Harland & Wolff shipyard for the
                 White Star Line during the early 20th century. They were Olympic (1911), Titanic (1912), and Britannic (1915).
                All three were designed to be the largest and most luxurious passenger ships in the world.

                Two were lost early in their careers: Titanic sank in 1912 on her maiden voyage after hitting an iceberg in the
                ocean, and Britannic in 1916 during World War I after hitting a mine laid by the minelayer submarine U-73 
                in a barrier off Kea in the Aegean Sea.

                    Although the two youngest vessels did not have successful careers, they are among the most famous ocean liners ever built. 
                    Both Olympic and Titanic briefly enjoyed the distinction of being the largest ships in the world; 
                    Olympic would be the largest British-built ship in the world for over 20 years
                    until the launch of RMS Queen Mary in 1936.
                    Titanic's story has been adapted into many books and films. Britannic has also inspired a film of the same name.
